For my soundscape preview, I have recorded my alarm clock ringing.  I also recorded a smacking sound to indicate the alarm being shut off.  I tried to make the first sound also have taping noises to indicate a sleepy person fumbling around looking to shut the alarm clock off.  I started the assignment off with a few seconds of silence to have the alarm sound very abrupt like it does in the morning.  Looking ahead, I am going to record more sounds of someone frantically getting ready.  I will then record sounds of traffic and crowds.
